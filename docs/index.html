        <h3>A play by William Shakespeare</h3>

        <p>The jealous King of Sicily becomes convinced that his wife is carrying the child of his best friend. Imprisoned and put on trial, the Queen collapses when the King refuses to accept divine confirmation of her innocence. The child is abandoned to die on the coast of Bohemia. But when she is found ans raised by a shepherd, it seems redemption may be possible.</p> 

        <p>The Winter’s Tale explores mortality and renewal, and the destructive and consoling effects of time.</p>

        <h3>Anecdotes</h3>

        <p class="subtitle">Winter's Tale</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First Performed: 1610-11</li>
          <li>First Printed: 1623</li>
        </ul>

          <p class="subtitle">W. Shakespeare
          </p>
        <ul>
          <li>One of the most famous, or infamous of Shakespeare’s stage directions, ‘Exit, pursued by a bear’ is in Act III of The Winter’s Tale.</li>
          <li>Kings must be crowned, and it is fitting that Shakespeare's belated coronation should have been held in the town of his birth. The Stratford jubilee (as its sponsors called it) took place, oddly, not on the bicentenary of the poet's birth in 1764 but five years later, and not, as one might expect, in April when he was born but in irrelevant September....
