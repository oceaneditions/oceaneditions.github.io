        <p>The jealous King of Sicily becomes convinced that his wife is carrying the child of his best friend. Imprisoned and put on trial, the Queen collapses when the King refuses to accept divine confirmation of her innocence. The child is abandoned to die on the coast of Bohemia. But when she is found ans raised by a shepherd, it seems redemption may be possible.</p> 

        <p>The Winter’s Tale explores mortality and renewal, and the destructive and consoling effects of time.</p>
