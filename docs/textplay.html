			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot, you shall see, as I have said, great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Camillo</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Archidamus</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be justified in our loves; for indeed—</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Camillo</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Beseech you—</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Archidamus</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge: we cannot with such magnificence, in so rare- I know not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience, may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse us.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Camillo</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">You pay a great deal too dear for what’s given freely.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Archidamus</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Camillo</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Sicilia cannot show himself overkind to Bohemia. They were train’d together in their childhoods; and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now. Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, their encounters, though not personal, have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies; that they have seem’d to be together, though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embrac’d as it were from the ends of opposed winds. The heavens continue their loves!</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Archidamus</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable comfort of your young Prince Mamillius; it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Camillo</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I very well agree with you in the hopes of him. It is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the subject, makes old hearts fresh; they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Archidamus</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Would they else be content to die?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Camillo</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Archidamus</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">If the King had no son, they would desire to live on crutches till he had one.</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Polixenes</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate: ‘tis a sickness denying thee anything; a death to grant this.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Camillo</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">It is fifteen years since I saw my country; though I have for the most part been aired abroad, I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent King, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay, or I o’erween to think so, which is another spur to my departure.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Polixenes</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">As thou lov’st me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now. The need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made. Better not to have had thee than thus to want thee; thou, having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute them thyself, or take away with thee the very services thou hast done; which if I have not enough considered- as too much I cannot- to be more thankful to thee shall be my study; and my profit therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country Sicilia, prithee, speak no more; whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent, as thou call’st him, and reconciled king, my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented. Say to me, when saw’st thou the Prince Florizel, my son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not being gracious, than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Camillo</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Sir, it is three days since I saw the Prince. What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown; but I have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court, and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Polixenes</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some care, so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness; from whom I have this intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd- a man, they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Camillo</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most rare note. The report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Polixenes</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">That’s likewise part of my intelligence; but, I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not appearing what we are, have some question with the shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son’s resort thither. Prithee be my present partner in this business, and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.</p>

I have sold all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad, knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, to keep my pack from fasting. They throng who should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer; by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture; and what I saw, to my good use I rememb’red. My clown, who wants but something to be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the wenches’ song that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words, which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears. You might have pinch’d a placket, it was senseless; ‘twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse; I would have fil’d keys off that hung in chains. No hearing, no feeling, but my sir’s song, and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this time of lethargy I pick’d and cut most of their festival purses; and had not the old man come in with whoobub against his daughter and the King’s son and scar’d my choughs from the chaff, I had not left a purse alive in the whole army.</p>

Sure, the gods do this year connive at us, and we may do anything extempore. The Prince himself is about a piece of iniquity- stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels.

But what talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to be smil’d at, their offences being so capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain men, what you have to the King.

			<h2 class="location" lang="en-GB">Sicilia. Before the palace of Leontes</h2>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">[Enter Autolycus and a Gentleman]</h2>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Autolycus</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">First Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it; whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all commanded out of the chamber; only this, methought I heard the shepherd say he found the child.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Autolycus</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I would most gladly know the issue of it.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">First Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceived in the King and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They seem’d almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture; they look’d as they had heard of a world ransom’d, or one destroyed. A notable passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if th’ importance were joy or sorrow- but in the extremity of the one it must needs be.</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">[Enter another Gentleman]</h2>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more. The news, Rogero?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Second Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Nothing but bonfires. The oracle is fulfill’d: the King’s daughter is found. Such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad-makers cannot be able to express it.</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">[Enter another Gentleman]</h2>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Here comes the Lady Paulina’s steward; he can deliver you more.How goes it now, sir? This news, which is call’d true, is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the King found his heir?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Third Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance. That which you hear you’ll swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle of Queen Hermione’s; her jewel about the neck of it; the letters of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character; the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother; the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding; and many other evidences- proclaim her with all certainty to be the King’s daughter. Did you see the meeting of the two kings?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Second Gentleman</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">No.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Third Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Then you have lost a sight which was to be seen, cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in such manner that it seem’d sorrow wept to take leave of them; for their joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment, not by favour.Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries ‘O, thy mother, thy mother!’ then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his daughter with clipping her. Now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings’ reigns. I never heard of such another encounter, which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Second Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried hence the child?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Third Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Like an old tale still, which will have matter to rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear open: he was torn to pieces with a bear. This avouches the shepherd’s son, who has not only his innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">First Gentleman</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Third Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Wreck’d the same instant of their master’s death, and in the view of the shepherd; so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found. But, O, the noble combat that ‘twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina! She had one eye declin’d for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle was fulfill’d. She lifted the Princess from the earth, and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin her to her heart, that she might no more be in danger of losing.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">First Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes; for by such was it acted.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Third Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">One of the prettiest touches of all, and that which angl’d for mine eyes- caught the water, though not the fish- was, when at the relation of the Queen’s death, with the manner how she came to’t bravely confess’d and lamented by the King, how attentivenes wounded his daughter; till, from one sign of dolour to another, she did with an ‘Alas!’- I would fain say- bleed tears; for I am sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed colour; some swooned, all sorrowed. If all the world could have seen’t, the woe had been universal.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">First Gentleman</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Are they returned to the court?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Third Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">No. The Princess hearing of her mother’s statue, which is in the keeping of Paulina- a piece many years in doing and now newly perform’d by that rare Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work, would beguile nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her ape. He so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer- thither with all greediness of affection are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Second Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I thought she had some great matter there in hand; for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione, visited that removed house. Shall we thither, and with our company piece the rejoicing?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">First Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Who would be thence that has the benefit of access? Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born. Our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge. Let’s along.</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">[Exeunt Gentlemen]</h2>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Autolycus</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old man and his son aboard the Prince; told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what; but he at that time over-fond of the shepherd’s daughter- so he then took her to be- who began to be much sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of weather continuing, this mystery remained undiscover’d. But ‘tis all one to me; for had I been the finder-out of this secret, it would not have relish’d among my other discredits.</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">[Enter Shepherd and Clown]</h2>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me this other day, because I was no gentleman born. See you these clothes? Say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born. You were best say these robes are not gentlemen born. Give me the lie, do; and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Autolycus</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Clown</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">So you have; but I was a gentleman born before my father; for the King’s son took me by the hand and call’d me brother; and then the two kings call’d my father brother; and then the Prince, my brother, and the Princess, my sister, call’d my father father. And so we wept; and there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Shepherd</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">We may live, son, to shed many more.</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Clown</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">How if it be false, son?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">If it be ne’er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend. And I’ll swear to the Prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk. But I’ll swear it; and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.</p>
